<|ref|>The text labeled 'Advanced' near the bottom center of the page, gray text on white background. Choose only ONE thing to locate.<|/ref|><|det|>[[0, 907, 999, 971]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The text labeled 'Advanced' near the bottom center of the page, gray text on white background'. Justification: The current Chrome screen shows a security warning about the site certificate. To proceed to the site and reach the X app website to search for t.me links, I will tap 'Advanced' to reveal further options that will allow me to proceed despite the warning.
Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The underlined blue text 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)' near the center of the screen, small sized text on a white background'. Justification: The current screen shows the advanced options after tapping 'Advanced' on a security warning page in Chrome. To proceed to the site and access the contents inside the domain where t.me links may be found, I will tap on 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)', which allows bypassing the security warning and continuing to the webpage.
Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The underlined blue text 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)' near the center of the screen, small sized text on a white background'. Justification: The current screen repeats the security warning with option to proceed. To bypass this warning and access the page with t.me links, I will tap on the 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)' link again to confirm and proceed into the website content.
Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.

Getting next action
<|ref|>The text link 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)', underlined and in small blue font near the page center. Choose only ONE thing to locate.<|/ref|><|det|>[[49, 382, 949, 403]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The text link 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)', underlined and in small blue font near the page center'. Justification: The current screen still shows the security warning page. The user already tapped the link once but was returned here again. Since the goal is to access 't.me' links for Telegram group chats to help search for recent Telegram invites, I will tap the 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)' link again to bypass the warning and try to enter the site content this time.
Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
<|ref|>The large blue button labeled 'Back to safety' at the bottom center of the screen<|/ref|><|det|>[[54, 833, 944, 884]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The large blue button labeled 'Back to safety' at the bottom center of the screen'. Justification: The current screen is a recurring security warning about an invalid certificate for the site 't.me'. The previous attempts to tap 'Proceed to t.me (unsafe)' have not successfully bypassed the warning. Since all the proceed links have been used already, the next logical action is to tap 'Back to safety' to exit the unsafe page and then try navigating to another way of searching t.me links, potentially from a safer starting point like via the X app directly in the browser.
Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
<|ref|>The text input field at the top center of the Chrome browser screen<|/ref|><|det|>[[40, 276, 955, 328]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The text input field at the top center of the Chrome browser screen, with the placeholder text 'Search or type web address', light gray background, and microphone and camera icons on the right'. Justification: The current screen shows the Chrome homepage with a search/address field. Since the previous attempts to directly access 't.me' were blocked by security warnings, I will use the Chrome address/search bar to instead go to the X (Twitter) website and search for 't.me' links for Telegram groups directly from there. This action aligns with the task goal of finding 't.me' links through the X app website by starting with their home or search page.
Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
<|ref|>text input field<|/ref|><|det|>[[18, 62, 980, 103]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: typing the following text: 'X.com' inside the input field 'the text input field at the top center of the Chrome browser screen, with the placeholder text 'Search or type web address', light gray background, and microphone and camera icons on the right'. Justification: To access the X app website from the Chrome home screen shown in the current screenshot, I will type 'X.com' in the search/address bar to go to the official X app (Twitter) site. This aligns with the goal to search for recent t.me Telegram links through the X app.
Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.6 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
<|ref|>the blue button labeled 'Update date and time' near the bottom center of the screen, white text on blue background. Choose only ONE thing to locate.<|/ref|><|det|>[[54, 833, 944, 884]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'the blue button labeled 'Update date and time' near the bottom center of the screen, white text on blue background'. Justification: The current screen shows a security warning in Chrome caused by incorrect device date/time. To fix this and avoid certificate errors on sites like X.com, tapping 'Update date and time' will open the system settings to correct the device date/time. This action helps achieve the goal by removing obstacles to browsing X.com and searching for t.me links.
Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
<|ref|>The back arrow icon at top left corner of the screen, black on white background, medium size. Choose only ONE thing to locate.<|/ref|><|det|>[[0, 61, 142, 111]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'The back arrow icon at top left corner of the screen, black on white background, medium size'. Justification: The current screen is the Date & Time settings page, opened from the previous action to update the device's date and time to fix Chrome certificate errors. To get back to the Chrome browser and continue the goal of searching t.me links on X.com, tapping the back arrow will close these settings and allow resuming the browsing session.

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'top right corner on the small grey 'X' icon to close the dialer keypad'. Justification: The current screen shows the dialpad in the phone app, but the goal is to create a new contact. Closing the dialpad will reveal the main phone app interface where the option to add a new contact is likely available.

----------step 5
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 0.6 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'blue text link labeled 'Add a favorite' in the center of the screen under the text about calling favorite contacts'. Justification: The current screen is the main phone app on the Favorites tab, showing a prompt to Add a favorite. To create a new contact, starting by adding a favorite may lead to the interface for selecting or creating contacts, which will progress towards adding a new contact for Hugo Pereira.
Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
Latest step: Action taken: going back. Justification: The current screen shows 'Choose a contact' but there are no contacts to select as none have phone numbers. The previous step tried to add a favorite which brought us here, but since there are no contacts it doesn't allow adding. Going back will take us to the main phone app screen which should have an option to add a new contact and better aligns with creating a new contact for Hugo Pereira.
Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.
New screenshot and previous screenshot made and being overlaid into the message
Getting next action
<|ref|>top right three vertical dots icon in the search contacts and places bar, light grey background with search bar, top right corner<|/ref|><|det|>[[844, 60, 938, 113]]<|/det|>
Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'top right three vertical dots icon in the search contacts and places bar, light grey background with search bar, top right corner'. Justification: On the current screen, we are in the phone app's Favorites tab main page. The search bar at the top right has three vertical dots for more options. Tapping this should open a menu with possible options like 'Add contact', which is relevant to create a new contact for Hugo Pereira.
Completed step 8.

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'Settings option in the dropdown menu at the top right corner, medium size text on white background near top center'. Justification: The current screen shows a dropdown where the top right three vertical dots were tapped, revealing options Call history, Settings, and Help & feedback. None of these options are 'Add contact'. We should tap Settings to explore options there that may lead to adding a new contact or opening the contacts list for adding a contact, progressing toward the goal.
Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Waiting for screen to stabilize before grabbing state... Fetched after 1.1 seconds.

Getting next action
Latest step: Action taken: going back. Justification: Current screen shows the phone app's Settings page, which is irrelevant for creating a new contact. Going back will return to the main phone app screen, where options to add a new contact are more likely. This is necessary because the previous tap on Settings did not lead to adding a contact.

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'the blue dial pad icon button with dots in the bottom right corner of the current screen'. Justification: The current screen is the main phone app on the Favorites tab, which shows no direct option to add a new contact. Tapping the dial pad blue button in the bottom right corner might open the dialer screen where adding a new contact is usually possible, helping to progress towards creating a new contact for Hugo Pereira.
Completed step 11.

Latest step: Action taken: tapping on the object described as: 'top left corner white background with three horizontal lines menu icon around the time indicator'. Justification: The current screen shows the phone app dialer keypad with no visible option to add a contact. Tapping the top left menu icon often opens phone app options including contacts and add contact. This will help access adding a new contact for Hugo Pereira.
